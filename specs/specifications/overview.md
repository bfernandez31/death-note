## Project Summary

death-note is a keyboard-driven typing game built with Zig and raylib. Zombies fall from the top of an 800×1000 portrait-arcade window in structured waves; the player destroys each zombie by typing its displayed name before it reaches the bottom of the screen. On every fifth wave a boss zombie spawns at 50% kills: larger, red-tinted, and requiring the player to type a full multi-word phrase to defeat it. While a boss is alive, regular zombie spawns pause so the boss phrase gets the player's full attention. Each wave's spawn cadence and fall speed are **derived from the wave's `target_wpm`** so the displayed challenge matches the real one: a player typing exactly at `target_wpm` keeps up with no slack. A missed zombie or boss triggers a 1-second dying pause, then an arcade-style game-over overlay (`GAME OVER` in glow + 3×2 stats grid: `SCORE` zero-padded to 6 digits, `WAVE REACHED`, `ENEMIES SLAIN`, `MAX COMBO`, `WPM`, `ACCURACY`); pressing Enter restarts from wave 1. The game opens to a main menu with two play modes: **Survival** (the original wave-based mode, now with power-up drops and a pause system) and **Zen** (constant-speed practice mode with WPM target selection, no game-over, no scoring). Power-ups (Freeze, Bomb, Shield) drop at 10% chance per kill in Survival mode and are activated with the Space bar from a single inventory slot. Best scores are persisted per mode — Survival in `highscore.dat` and Zen in `highscore-zen.dat` on native builds, with corresponding separate `localStorage` keys on web builds. All high score persistence logic lives in `src/highscore.zig`. A live HUD displays the running WPM and accuracy; the WPM timer arms on the first keystroke of each wave and resets on wave transitions, so each wave reads as its own typing-test segment. The game features a complete audio system: typing packs (click, typewriter, hitmarker) play round-robin on correct keystrokes, error packs play on mistyped letters, distinct sounds fire for each power-up activation, the existing kill sound is routed through a volume/toggle system, and a dark synthwave background music track loops seamlessly during gameplay. All audio preferences (five category toggles, two pack selectors, three independent volume sliders) are configurable through a "Sound" settings screen accessible from both the main menu and the pause menu, and are persisted in `soundconfig.dat` / `localStorage` between sessions via `src/sound_config.zig`.

The game is a single-file-dominant desktop application aimed at anyone who wants a minimalist, fast-compilation typing challenge. There is no server and no network component: the entire experience runs locally from a single native executable (`death-note`) built with Zig's integrated build system.

Core value comes from simplicity and hackability. The primary game logic lives in `src/main.zig`, with shared type definitions extracted to `src/zombie_types.zig` and persistence isolated in `src/highscore.zig`; raylib handles all windowing, rendering, audio, and input. Difficulty, wave parameters, and spawn timing are tuned by editing compile-time constants at the top of `src/main.zig`, making the project an accessible starting point for Zig and raylib learners.

## Architecture Overview

death-note follows a classic game-loop architecture: initialize resources, loop over update-then-draw, teardown on exit. There are no layers of abstraction beyond a thin C-interop wall. The primary gameplay surface lives in `src/main.zig`; `src/raylib.zig` re-exports raylib symbols; `src/zombie_names.zig` supplies the zombie name pool; `src/boss_phrases.zig` supplies the boss phrase pool; `src/zombie_types.zig` exports shared enums and tables; `src/highscore.zig` handles per-mode score persistence; `src/sound_config.zig` handles sound preference persistence and exposes the `SoundConfig`, `TypingPack`, and `ErrorPack` types.

The game has six UI screens tracked by `current_screen: GameScreen`: **MainMenu**, **WpmSelect**, **Playing**, **Paused**, **GameOver**, and **SoundSettings**. The **SoundSettings** screen is reachable from both **MainMenu** and **Paused** via the "SOUND" menu item; `sound_menu_return_screen` records the originating screen so Escape returns correctly. Within the **Playing** screen, two sub-states — **Dying** and **Transitioning** — gate updates via `is_dying` and `is_transitioning`. Game mode (`game_mode: GameMode`) determines whether Survival or Zen rules apply throughout the playing state. During `Playing`, the update phase runs: input is captured (limit dynamically 9 or 35 characters via `getCurrentMaxInput()`), the first printable keypress of the wave arms the WPM timer (`wpm_timer_started`), each keypress is classified as correct or incorrect, `spawn_timer` accumulates, `spawnZombie` fires at the wave's derived `spawn_delay` **only while no boss is alive**, `updateBoss` advances the boss and checks for phrase completion, `updateZombies` advances regular zombies and checks for name matches, and `updateMetrics` advances `elapsed_time` (only while `wpm_timer_started`) and smooths the WPM and accuracy display values. On boss waves (multiples of 5), `spawnBoss` fires at 50% kills. When all pool zombies are spawned and killed — and the boss is defeated on boss waves — the game enters `Transitioning`: a 3-second countdown after which `current_wave` advances, metrics are reset (`resetMetricsState`) for the new wave's typing-test segment, and the next wave begins. The combo (`combo_count`) is **not** reset between waves; it survives until the player mistypes or dies. `max_combo` records the session-wide peak for the game-over screen. If any zombie or the boss crosses `screen_height`, the game enters `Dying`: all updates pause for 1 second while the responsible regular zombie (if any) is tinted red. When the timer expires the high score comparison runs, the record is persisted if beaten, and the game moves to `GameOver` showing the 3×2 arcade stats grid. Pressing Enter resets all session state — including power-up state (`held_power_up = null`, `freeze_timer = 0`, `shield_active = false`) via `resetSessionState` — preserves the best score in memory, and restarts from wave 1.

## Development Setup

All commands are run from the repository root. The game must be run from the root (or via `zig build run`) so that relative asset paths (`assets/…`) resolve correctly.

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Build (install to `zig-out/`) | `zig build` |
| Build and run the game | `zig build run` |
| Pass arguments to the game | `zig build run -- <args>` |
| Run unit tests | `zig build test` |
| **Build WebAssembly bundle** (requires Emscripten SDK 3.1.64) | `zig build web` |
| Web release build (recommended for deploy) | `zig build web -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall` |
| Serve web bundle locally | `python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory zig-out/web` |
| Type-check (compile without running) | `zig build --summary all` |
| Format check | `zig fmt --check .` |
| Release build (optimize for speed) | `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` |
| Release build (raylib separately optimized) | `zig build -Draylib-optimize=ReleaseFast` |
| Strip debug info | `zig build -Dstrip=true` |
| List all build steps | `zig build --help` |

No separate dependency installation step is needed for native builds: `zig build` fetches and compiles the pinned raylib commit automatically via the Zig package manager. For the `web` target, the Emscripten SDK (`emsdk`) must be installed and activated separately — see `specs/DEATHN-1-build-and-deploy/deployment-guide.md` for step-by-step instructions.

## Key Conventions

The following conventions are derived from `CLAUDE.md` and `.ai-board/memory/constitution.md` and are enforced across all source changes.

**Resource lifecycle.** Every `Init…` / `Load…` call is immediately followed on the next line by a `defer Close…` / `Unload…`. This guarantees deterministic cleanup without relying on process exit. New resource loads must follow this idiom without exception.

**C interop wall.** `@cImport` appears only in `src/raylib.zig`. All game code imports that wrapper module and uses its re-exported symbols. Do not add `@cImport` anywhere else.

**Named compile-time constants.** Magic numbers are not permitted inline. All tunables (`MAX_ZOMBIES`, `MAX_INPUT_CHARS`, `ZOMBIE_FRAME_COUNT`, `WAVE_TRANSITION_DURATION`, `WAVE_BASE_WPM`, `WAVE_WPM_INCREMENT`, `WAVE_MAX_WPM`, `WAVE_DURATION_TARGET_S`, `SPAWN_DELAY_BASE`, `TIME_ON_SCREEN_BASE`, `STARTER_PACK_BASE`, `screen_width`, `screen_height`) are declared at the top of `src/main.zig`. New tunables follow the same pattern.

**Naming discipline.**
- Variables and runtime state: `snake_case` (`spawn_timer`, `is_game_over`, `letter_count`).
- Compile-time constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (`MAX_ZOMBIES`, `ZOMBIE_FRAME_COUNT`).
- Functions: `camelCase` (`spawnZombie`, `updateZombies`, `drawZombies`, `resetZombies`).
- Types: `PascalCase` (`Zombie`, `ZombieNames`).
- Upstream raylib identifiers: kept in original C casing (`InitWindow`, `DrawTexturePro`).

**Optional pointer unwrapping.** Zombie slots are `?*Zombie` and must be unwrapped with `if (zombie) |zomb| { … }`. Force-unwrapping via `.?` is not used in gameplay code.

**Allocator threading.** Functions that allocate (`spawnZombie`, `resetZombies`) accept `allocator: *std.mem.Allocator` as a parameter. Helpers do not reach into `std.heap.page_allocator` directly, enabling allocator substitution (e.g. arena allocator in tests).

**Error handling.** Fallible functions return `!T` and are called with `try`. Allocation success paths use `errdefer allocator.destroy(…)` to prevent leaks on partial failure. `catch unreachable` is not used in gameplay code.

**Fixed-size pools.** Entities live in a compile-time-bounded slot array (`[MAX_ZOMBIES]?*Zombie`) with an `is_active` flag. When adding new entity kinds, apply the same pattern. Capacity changes are made by adjusting the constant, not the data structure.

**Bounded input.** The typing buffer write site checks both character class (`key >= 32 and key <= 125`) and length (`letter_count < MAX_INPUT_CHARS`) before writing. All new text-input surfaces must enforce the same two guards at the write site.

**C-string length.** Zombie names (`[*:0]const u8`) have their length computed by scanning to `'\x00'`. Comparisons use `std.mem.eql(u8, slice_a, slice_b)`, never raw pointer arithmetic.

**Asset paths are literals.** `LoadTexture` and `LoadSound` are called only with constant string literals from `assets/`. Asset paths are never derived from runtime input.

**Dependency pinning.** `build.zig.zon` pins raylib by both commit URL and content hash. Bumps must update both fields together and are subject to review.

**Formatting and compilation gate.** `zig build` (which compiles and type-checks) is the required gate before merge. Run `zig fmt` on files you touch. No separate linter is configured.
