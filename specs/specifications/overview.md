## Project Summary

death-note is a keyboard-driven typing game built with Zig and raylib. Zombies fall from the top of an 800×450 window in structured waves; the player destroys each zombie by typing its displayed name before it reaches the bottom of the screen. Waves escalate in speed and zombie count using a per-wave difficulty table. A missed zombie triggers game over; pressing Enter restarts from wave 1.

The game is a single-file-dominant desktop application aimed at anyone who wants a minimalist, fast-compilation typing challenge. There is no server, no persistence, and no network component: the entire experience runs locally from a single native executable (`death-note`) built with Zig's integrated build system.

Core value comes from simplicity and hackability. The entire game logic lives in `src/main.zig`, with raylib handling all windowing, rendering, audio, and input. Difficulty, wave parameters, and spawn timing are tuned by editing compile-time constants at the top of that file, making the project an accessible starting point for Zig and raylib learners.

## Tech Stack

| Category | Technology | Version | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Language | Zig | Toolchain default (no `.zig-version` pinned) | Primary implementation language; compiles, type-checks, and links the game |
| Build system | Zig built-in (`build.zig`) | Same as language toolchain | Declarative build graph: executable, test step, raylib linkage, install step |
| Package manifest | `build.zig.zon` | Same as language toolchain | Declares and pins the single external dependency (raylib) by URL and content hash |
| Graphics / windowing / input / audio | raylib | Pinned to commit `52f2a10db610d0e9f619fd7c521db08a876547d0` | Window management, 2-D rendering, spritesheet animation, keyboard/mouse input, WAV playback |
| C interop layer | `@cImport` (Zig built-in) | Same as language toolchain | Imports `raylib.h`, `raymath.h`, `rlgl.h`, and (for WASM target) `emscripten/emscripten.h`; walled off in `src/raylib.zig` |
| WebAssembly toolchain | Emscripten SDK | Pinned to `3.1.64` (build-time only; not required for native builds) | Compiles the game to WASM and provides WebGL / audio / input browser glue for the `zig build web` target |
| Allocator | `std.heap.page_allocator` (Zig stdlib) | Same as language toolchain | Allocates individual `Zombie` structs at spawn time; freed on death or reset |
| Random number generation | `std.Random.DefaultPrng` / `Xoshiro256` (Zig stdlib) | Same as language toolchain | Picks zombie spawn X position and name index |
| Font | JetBrains Mono Nerd Font Thin (`assets/JetBrainsMonoNerdFont-Thin.ttf`) | Bundled asset | Available for UI text rendering |
| Audio asset | `assets/zombie-hit.wav` | Bundled asset | Played via raylib when a zombie is killed |
| Sprite asset | `assets/z_spritesheet.png` | Bundled asset | 17-frame horizontal spritesheet for zombie walk animation |

## Architecture Overview

death-note follows a classic game-loop architecture: initialize resources, loop over update-then-draw, teardown on exit. There are no layers of abstraction beyond a thin C-interop wall. The entire gameplay surface lives in `src/main.zig`; `src/raylib.zig` re-exports raylib symbols; `src/zombie_names.zig` supplies the name pool.

    Main --> WaveTable
    Main --> InputBuf
    RaylibWrapper --> RaylibLib
    RaylibLib --> Window
    RaylibLib --> AudioDevice
    RaylibLib --> Assets
```

The game has three states: **Playing**, **Transitioning**, and **GameOver**. During `Playing`, the update phase runs: input is captured, `spawn_timer` accumulates, `spawnZombie` fires at the current wave's spawn rate up to the wave's `pool_size` quota, and `updateZombies` advances each zombie's `y` and checks for typed-name matches via `std.mem.eql`. When all wave zombies are spawned and killed, the game enters `Transitioning` — a 3-second countdown after which `current_wave` advances and the next wave begins. If any zombie's `y` crosses `screen_height`, the game enters `GameOver`; pressing Enter resets all state and restarts from wave 1. Fall speed and spawn timing scale per-wave using `getWaveConfig(current_wave)` backed by the compile-time `WAVE_TABLE`.

## Development Setup

All commands are run from the repository root. The game must be run from the root (or via `zig build run`) so that relative asset paths (`assets/…`) resolve correctly.

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Build (install to `zig-out/`) | `zig build` |
| Build and run the game | `zig build run` |
| Pass arguments to the game | `zig build run -- <args>` |
| Run unit tests | `zig build test` |
| **Build WebAssembly bundle** (requires Emscripten SDK 3.1.64) | `zig build web` |
| Web release build (recommended for deploy) | `zig build web -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall` |
| Serve web bundle locally | `python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory zig-out/web` |
| Type-check (compile without running) | `zig build --summary all` |
| Format check | `zig fmt --check .` |
| Release build (optimize for speed) | `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` |
| Release build (raylib separately optimized) | `zig build -Draylib-optimize=ReleaseFast` |
| Strip debug info | `zig build -Dstrip=true` |
| List all build steps | `zig build --help` |

No separate dependency installation step is needed for native builds: `zig build` fetches and compiles the pinned raylib commit automatically via the Zig package manager. For the `web` target, the Emscripten SDK (`emsdk`) must be installed and activated separately — see `specs/DEATHN-1-build-and-deploy/deployment-guide.md` for step-by-step instructions.

## Key Conventions

The following conventions are derived from `CLAUDE.md` and `.ai-board/memory/constitution.md` and are enforced across all source changes.

**Resource lifecycle.** Every `Init…` / `Load…` call is immediately followed on the next line by a `defer Close…` / `Unload…`. This guarantees deterministic cleanup without relying on process exit. New resource loads must follow this idiom without exception.

**C interop wall.** `@cImport` appears only in `src/raylib.zig`. All game code imports that wrapper module and uses its re-exported symbols. Do not add `@cImport` anywhere else.

**Named compile-time constants.** Magic numbers are not permitted inline. All tunables (`MAX_ZOMBIES`, `MAX_INPUT_CHARS`, `ZOMBIE_FRAME_COUNT`, `WAVE_TRANSITION_DURATION`, `WAVE_TABLE`, `screen_width`, `screen_height`) are declared at the top of `src/main.zig`. New tunables follow the same pattern.

**Naming discipline.**
- Variables and runtime state: `snake_case` (`spawn_timer`, `is_game_over`, `letter_count`).
- Compile-time constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (`MAX_ZOMBIES`, `ZOMBIE_FRAME_COUNT`).
- Functions: `camelCase` (`spawnZombie`, `updateZombies`, `drawZombies`, `resetZombies`).
- Types: `PascalCase` (`Zombie`, `ZombieNames`).
- Upstream raylib identifiers: kept in original C casing (`InitWindow`, `DrawTexturePro`).

**Optional pointer unwrapping.** Zombie slots are `?*Zombie` and must be unwrapped with `if (zombie) |zomb| { … }`. Force-unwrapping via `.?` is not used in gameplay code.

**Allocator threading.** Functions that allocate (`spawnZombie`, `resetZombies`) accept `allocator: *std.mem.Allocator` as a parameter. Helpers do not reach into `std.heap.page_allocator` directly, enabling allocator substitution (e.g. arena allocator in tests).

**Error handling.** Fallible functions return `!T` and are called with `try`. Allocation success paths use `errdefer allocator.destroy(…)` to prevent leaks on partial failure. `catch unreachable` is not used in gameplay code.

**Fixed-size pools.** Entities live in a compile-time-bounded slot array (`[MAX_ZOMBIES]?*Zombie`) with an `is_active` flag. When adding new entity kinds, apply the same pattern. Capacity changes are made by adjusting the constant, not the data structure.

**Bounded input.** The typing buffer write site checks both character class (`key >= 32 and key <= 125`) and length (`letter_count < MAX_INPUT_CHARS`) before writing. All new text-input surfaces must enforce the same two guards at the write site.

**C-string length.** Zombie names (`[*:0]const u8`) have their length computed by scanning to `'\x00'`. Comparisons use `std.mem.eql(u8, slice_a, slice_b)`, never raw pointer arithmetic.

**Asset paths are literals.** `LoadTexture` and `LoadSound` are called only with constant string literals from `assets/`. Asset paths are never derived from runtime input.

**Dependency pinning.** `build.zig.zon` pins raylib by both commit URL and content hash. Bumps must update both fields together and are subject to review.

**Formatting and compilation gate.** `zig build` (which compiles and type-checks) is the required gate before merge. Run `zig fmt` on files you touch. No separate linter is configured.
